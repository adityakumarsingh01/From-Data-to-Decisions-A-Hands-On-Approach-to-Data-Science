1. Data Visualization and Business Intelligence (BI): Demonstrated proficiency in Power BI and Excel by developing NYC-311-Noise-Dashboard and Adventure-Works-Sales-Analysis, showcasing the ability to transform raw data into actionable visual insights for decision-makers.

2. Comprehensive Data Analysis Workflow: Executed a full-scale data science project, RISK-BEHAVIOR-ANALYSIS, which involved Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data manipulation (Excel), building Machine Learning (ML) models, and presenting results via Power BI.

3. Core Data Science Foundations: Gained hands-on experience in the structured process of data science, moving "From Data to Decisions," including data collection, cleaning, processing, modeling (ML), and communication of findings to drive outcomes.

Data Science & Analytics: Completed a professional skill development course, "From Data to Decisions: A Hands-On Approach to Data Science," and applied skills to develop complex BI dashboards (e.g., NYC-311 Noise Dashboard, Adventure-Works Sales Analysis) and end-to-end data science projects, including RISK-BEHAVIOR-ANALYSIS (involving EDA, ML model building, and Power BI reporting).
